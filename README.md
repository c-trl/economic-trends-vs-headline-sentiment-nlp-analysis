#Economic Trends vs Headline Sentiment NLP Analysis

This project aims to find symmetry in economic trends and news headline sentiment.  It is expected that as economic downturn approaches, headline sentiment begins to decrease.  For example, warnings of impending recession before the Great Recession in 2007 in headlines should be reflected in significant decreases in news headline sentiment as late as Q3 2007.  

First, a timeline of economic trends will be defined which will be used to reference news headline sentiment against.  Potential applications of this study include utilizing news headline sentiment as a possible predictor for economic trends.  While prediction of the economy as a whole is a large attempt, perhaps certain individual economic indicators may be predictable by headline sentiment.
